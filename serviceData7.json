    "largeDescription": "Inhouse Pharmecy is a modern healthcare model which makes managing your healthcare so much easier and more affordable. Instead of traditional care with co-pay, deductible and unexpected medical bills, Direct Primary Care is built on a monthly subscription membership (much like a gym membership). It includes unlimited visits to TrustCare clinics for primary care, urgent care, virtual care, routine laboratory testing and a comprehensive menu of procedures."
