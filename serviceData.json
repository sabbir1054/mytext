    "largeDescription": "The emergency department is the most stressful and critical area of a hospital to work in. Despite this, the area creates the most significant impact on saving lives and hospital success. Getting management right requires the right resources, processes, and consistency. Using a combination of technology, strategy, and improvement, hospitals can improve satisfaction, decrease leaving rates, and improve profitability.At the core, a hospital provides a service and the patients are the customers. ED management focuses on patient satisfaction. With feedback from doctors, nurses, and patients, practical strategies and technologies improve buy-in. Training for medical staff to greet and care at the first point of contact is critical. All steps must keep patients in mind. Above all, ED management is essential in creating a smooth patient experience."

    "largeDescription": "Blood bank testing should start with a type and screen. Note that a type and screen is valid for 3 days. A negative screen denotes that the patient does not have preformed antibodies. A positive screen means that the blood bank will require additional time to determine the nature of the antibody; if the antibody is considered to be clinically significant, the blood bank will have to find corresponding antigen-negative blood. See the chapter “Blood Bank Testing and Blood Products” for an in-depth discussion on blood bank testing."

    "largeDescription": "Nights and weekends are the times when most people are admitted to the hospital. They are also synonymous with reduced staffing levels and fewer specialized diagnostic, procedural, and treatment options. Indeed, there is increasing evidence suggesting that patient care is compromised during these times. Equally important is the inefficient use of capital investments during nights and weekends, and inappropriate utilization of hospital beds caused by poor weekend discharge flexibility. We believe that these findings should be of concern not just to hospital care providers, but across care settings and to the general public. In this perspective article, we highlight how our current office-hours system of running hospitals threatens the lives of our sickest, most vulnerable patients, describe solutions currently implemented in hospitals that may alleviate this disparity, and discuss challenges to wider scale implementation."
